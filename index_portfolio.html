        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, Im Leigh and I enjoy playing video games, spending time with my family and making improvements to our home.
            I currently work as a Boilermaker, as I plan my career change to Web Development. I enjoy working with and learning about 
            computer programming, and not just with html and javascript but Python alsp. Although sometimes I find it a bit overwhelming, it is still
            something I'll push myself to learn and understand.

        <p>A project I've worked on in the past, an income tax calculator based off of a particular years tax table. One is
            able to enter in details of their wage and not only calculate their tax but also their hourly rate! 
            if such details are unknown. One may calculate their income on a weekly basis, two weekly, monthly and annualy too!
            Deductions can be added and then calculated into their taxable income.
            <br>
            <br>
            I have also done some practice with forms and created a credit card payment page. Strictly just practice, and it is still work
            in progress.
